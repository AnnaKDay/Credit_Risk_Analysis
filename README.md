# Overview
This analysis was conducted to compare 6 different supervised machine learning models to predict credit card risk based on a variety of factors. Furthermore, it strives to identify the most important factors to deciding credit card risk. The goal is to test each model and see which ones handle credit card risk (which is an unbalanced classification) prediction with the least bias and the best accuracy.
